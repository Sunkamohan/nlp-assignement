bts members and their net worth is often discussed army has often their financial habits members like jungkook are known to be frugal while rm aka kim namjoon has expensive tastes like art we have read stories of their expensive homes but they boys are not showoffs except for their fancy wardrobes that have best of brands well bts members played a game where they were given an imaginary  billion korean won to invest in all the seven had to come up with business propositions and each member was told to divide the money this special game was a part of army membership on weverse well jin said he would plan a food delivery business while suga wants to start a hiphop label jung hoseok aka jhope is interested in a global clothing brand while rm would like to invest in art kim taehyung aka v would like to open a pet hotel while jimin and jungkook had plans for dance and vocal schools the results of the exercise has army in splits jin aka kim seokjin said he would not invest a single paise in suga or jhopes business saying that both were flop ventures on the other hand everyone thought that jins idea was a good one suga aka min yoongi proved to be the most prudent of all the leader of bts gave zero important to his own art business but saw immense spark in everyone else take a look at the results fans have noticed how jimin gave away all the money to jungkook but jin has people cracking up with his choices suga aka min yoongi has also saved some cash after the investments,"on january   bigbang member taeyang released his longawaited comeback with a single named lsquovibersquo and the other thing making the music world go gaga over this release was the featuring artists  taeyang had brought in bts member jimin to collaborate on this song and it soon took over the kpop world in a frenzy  this amalgamation of taeyangrsquos longadored vocals returning after  years and jiminrsquos charismatic presence venturing into his solo world was one nobody expected but everyone celebrated soon after its announcement 

the question however remained where did the thought of lsquovibersquo first begin who first approached whom and if any difficulties stood between them while working on the song  taeyang held a countdown live broadcast an hour before dropping the song on theblacklabelrsquos youtube channel and delved into the details of this collaboration 

taeyang spills about collaboration with jimin

on being asked where did the idea of working with jimin first stem from the bigbang member recalled an incident on a casual night in theblacklabel studio after dinner he was conversing with producer teddy park who is known for being the man behind a lot of blackpinkrsquos superhit tracks like lsquoas if its your lastrsquo lsquoddudu ddudursquo and the girls solo tracks and is also the cofounder of theblacklabel which is taeyangrsquos new agency  while thinking about his upcoming projects including a solo album the popular producer mentioned how fun it would be to have taeyang and jimin on one song  he added that if the two worked together people would love it  this was also when bts primarily did group activities and the members were not as active as solo artists nbsp

teddy parkrsquos words in passing were taken seriously by the  yearold as the thought stuck in his mind  while he had never pondered over the possibility before the simple mention made him think of a great collaboration that would come to fruition a couple of years later 

how did taeyang and jimin meet

bigbang and bts are two supergroups that have made themselves known globally  the members each have a massive fan following  but unfortunately theyrsquove never been spotted together previously up until  when they began attending similar events and going to the same parties  taeyang seemed to be aware of this gap in their matching schedules as he mentioned how their promotional activities had never overlapped before  moreover the singer had also never asked anyone to collaborate with him before this and found it difficult to come across someone hersquod like to work with 

to his rescue last year there were a few dinners that the bigbang member got invited to where he had an opportunity to meet bts  taeyang spoke about coming across the grouprsquos members one by one and eventually becoming acquainted with jimin  simple chats later they ended up talking about working together some day and taeyang asked jimin if hersquod like for them to make music together which finally resulted in going to the studio and working on the track that is now called lsquovibersquo 

taeyang and jimin shooting for vibe

the singer also spoke about working for other promotional bits like teaser photos at the music video filming site  he added that they tried to add an older feel to the song making them feel like a hip hop duo 

manoeuvring their different labels

taeyang belonged to yg entertainment when the creation of this song first began and has since moved to its subsidiary theblacklabel following the expiration of his exclusive contract in december   on the other hand bts member jimin is an artist with bighit music and overall to hybe  moreover it is rare for the bigbang members to collaborate with someone more so outside of their own agency  so taeyang spoke about having to work out that bit for the song and how he as well as jimin wished to make a great song as well as the music video for lsquovibersquo  during a recent interview with rolling stone the singer talked of the bts member taking a lot of effort for this song which he had come to appreciate greatly 

vibe choreography

taeyang and jimin are known to be quick on their feet however the former had not worked on his dancing skills for quite some time now while the latter had a different style than what they were aiming for this song which led the two of them to face some difficulties while learning the steps making them wonder about the reason and if it was really a tough collection of steps

"on january   bigbang member taeyang released his longawaited comeback with a single named lsquovibersquo and the other thing making the music world go gaga over this release was the featuring artists  taeyang had brought in bts member jimin to collaborate on this song and it soon took over the kpop world in a frenzy  this amalgamation of taeyangrsquos longadored vocals returning after  years and jiminrsquos charismatic presence venturing into his solo world was one nobody expected but everyone celebrated soon after its announcement 

the question however remained where did the thought of lsquovibersquo first begin who first approached whom and if any difficulties stood between them while working on the song  taeyang held a countdown live broadcast an hour before dropping the song on theblacklabelrsquos youtube channel and delved into the details of this collaboration 

taeyang spills about collaboration with jimin

on being asked where did the idea of working with jimin first stem from the bigbang member recalled an incident on a casual night in theblacklabel studio after dinner he was conversing with producer teddy park who is known for being the man behind a lot of blackpinkrsquos superhit tracks like lsquoas if its your lastrsquo lsquoddudu ddudursquo and the girls solo tracks and is also the cofounder of theblacklabel which is taeyangrsquos new agency  while thinking about his upcoming projects including a solo album the popular producer mentioned how fun it would be to have taeyang and jimin on one song  he added that if the two worked together people would love it  this was also when bts primarily did group activities and the members were not as active as solo artists nbsp

teddy parkrsquos words in passing were taken seriously by the  yearold as the thought stuck in his mind  while he had never pondered over the possibility before the simple mention made him think of a great collaboration that would come to fruition a couple of years later 

how did taeyang and jimin meet

bigbang and bts are two supergroups that have made themselves known globally  the members each have a massive fan following  but unfortunately theyrsquove never been spotted together previously up until  when they began attending similar events and going to the same parties  taeyang seemed to be aware of this gap in their matching schedules as he mentioned how their promotional activities had never overlapped before  moreover the singer had also never asked anyone to collaborate with him before this and found it difficult to come across someone hersquod like to work with 

to his rescue last year there were a few dinners that the bigbang member got invited to where he had an opportunity to meet bts  taeyang spoke about coming across the grouprsquos members one by one and eventually becoming acquainted with jimin  simple chats later they ended up talking about working together some day and taeyang asked jimin if hersquod like for them to make music together which finally resulted in going to the studio and working on the track that is now called lsquovibersquo 

taeyang and jimin shooting for vibe

the singer also spoke about working for other promotional bits like teaser photos at the music video filming site  he added that they tried to add an older feel to the song making them feel like a hip hop duo 

manoeuvring their different labels

taeyang belonged to yg entertainment when the creation of this song first began and has since moved to its subsidiary theblacklabel following the expiration of his exclusive contract in december   on the other hand bts member jimin is an artist with bighit music and overall to hybe  moreover it is rare for the bigbang members to collaborate with someone more so outside of their own agency  so taeyang spoke about having to work out that bit for the song and how he as well as jimin wished to make a great song as well as the music video for lsquovibersquo  during a recent interview with rolling stone the singer talked of the bts member taking a lot of effort for this song which he had come to appreciate greatly 

vibe choreography

taeyang and jimin are known to be quick on their feet however the former had not worked on his dancing skills for quite some time now while the latter had a different style than what they were aiming for this song which led the two of them to face some difficulties while learning the steps making them wonder about the reason and if it was really a tough collection of steps
