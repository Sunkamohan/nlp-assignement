One possible way to implement this NLP pipeline using TF-IDF is as follows:

Start by importing the necessary libraries, such as pandas for reading and manipulating the data, and sklearn for calculating the TF-IDF scores.
Read in the csv file containing the news data, and extract the content column.
Tokenize the content column into sentences.
Calculate the TF-IDF scores for each sentence using the sklearn library.
Sort the sentences by their TF-IDF scores in descending order.
Select a threshold for the minimum TF-IDF score, and keep only the sentences that have a score above this threshold.
Concatenate the remaining sentences to form a summary of the content.
Create a new dataframe with the title, source, published_at, topic, and summary columns.
remove the repeated and redundant rows and columns from the dataframe.
Output the original content, new content, removed lines and further metrics.



What is TD-IDF:
The TF-IDF score of a word is calculated as the product of its term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF).

Term frequency (TF) is the number of times a word appears in a document, normalized by the total number of words in the document.
Inverse document frequency (IDF) is the logarithm of the number of documents in the collection divided by the number of documents where the word appears.

What is Bag of Words:
Bag of Words (BoW) is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to represent text data in a numerical format. 
It is a way of extracting features from text data, where the text is represented as a bag (or unordered set) of its words, 
disregarding grammar and word order but keeping track of the frequency of each word.

The basic idea behind BoW is to take a piece of text, 
tokenize it (i.e., break it down into individual words), 
and then count the number of occurrences of each word. The resulting word counts can then be used as 
features for text classification, clustering, or other NLP tasks.
