What is TD-IDF:
The TF-IDF score of a word is calculated as the product of its term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF).

Term frequency (TF) is the number of times a word appears in a document, normalized by the total number of words in the document.
Inverse document frequency (IDF) is the logarithm of the number of documents in the collection divided by the number of documents where the word appears.

What is Bag of Words:
Bag of Words (BoW) is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to represent text data in a numerical format. 
It is a way of extracting features from text data, where the text is represented as a bag (or unordered set) of its words, 
disregarding grammar and word order but keeping track of the frequency of each word.

The basic idea behind BoW is to take a piece of text, 
tokenize it (i.e., break it down into individual words), 
and then count the number of occurrences of each word. The resulting word counts can then be used as 
features for text classification, clustering, or other NLP tasks.
